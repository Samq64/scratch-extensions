# Scratch Extensions

This is a repository for my [Scratch 3.0](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/) custom extensions.


### Loading an extension

To load an extension, open the [E羊icques](https://sheeptester.github.io/scratch-gui/) editor, set the `load_plugin` parameter to the extension URL (preferably URI encoded) and reload. These extensions won't load from the E羊icques extention menu, [https://turbowarp.org](TurboWarp) or Scratch. Projects that use custom extensions will not load unless the extension is loaded first.
